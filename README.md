## Brief description
This is a RUSA ACP controle time calculator built with Flask and AJAX. Main logic is contained in the acp_times.py file, using algorithm from site listed below.

ACP controle times
That's "controle" with an e, because it's French, although "control" is also accepted. Controls are points where a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the minimum and maximum times by which the rider must arrive at the location.

The algorithm for calculating controle times is described here https://rusa.org/pages/acp-brevet-control-times-calculator. Additional background information is given here https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders.
